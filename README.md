🧠 Intelligent Document Automation System

An AI-powered solution integrating MinerU + InvoiceNet for automated document understanding, extraction, and processing.

🚀 Overview

The Intelligent Document Automation System is an end-to-end pipeline that leverages AI, NLP, and deep learning to automatically extract structured information from unstructured documents such as invoices, receipts, and reports.

This project integrates:

MinerU for intelligent OCR and document layout parsing.

InvoiceNet for entity recognition and field extraction using deep learning.

🎯 Key Features

✅ End-to-end document understanding pipeline
✅ Automated extraction of key fields (Invoice No., Date, Total, Vendor, etc.)
✅ Integration of OCR + Deep Learning models
✅ Modular structure for scalability and future enhancements
✅ Designed for real-world enterprise automation use-cases
